# Exploring Server-Side Development with Twilio

## Description

In this lab, you'll have a chance to build a few tools using Twilio: a service that supports SMS texting and voice, among other things,
over the Internet.

Twilio's main use is to allow web applications to incorporate texting or automated voice call capabilities. This can include, for example,
two-factor authentication or interactive chatbot-type systems over SMS.
